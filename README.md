# Trendogate-Scraping-code.
I used TrendoGate website which has the archived data regarding the trending Twitter hashtags. On this website, I applied the country and date filter to narrow down my search. For ex – country as ‘India’ and date as ‘1/1/2019 to till today’.The obtained results were nothing but the trending hashtags for that particular day. Upon clicking on each hashtag, we are redirected to a page which shows all the tweets which has that hashtag used in it. So likewise, I fetched all the tweets which are linked to all those hashtags which were trending on that particular day.
